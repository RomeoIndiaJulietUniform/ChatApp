# ChatApp üí¨

## Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è
ChatApp is a real-time chat application designed to connect people and groups based on specific unique IDs (UIDs). Unlike traditional messaging apps, ChatApp prioritizes user privacy by not requiring phone number verification. Instead, it utilizes email verification, allowing users to maintain separation between their public and personal lives while respecting their privacy.

## Features ‚ú®
- Unique ID-based connections: Users can connect with individuals and groups based on specific unique IDs.
- Email verification: Ensures user authenticity while respecting privacy by utilizing email verification instead of phone numbers.
- Real-time messaging: Users can send and receive messages instantly.
- Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and securely authenticate using Auth0.
- Persistent storage: Messages are stored in MongoDB for persistence.
- Cross-origin resource sharing: CORS is implemented for secure communication between client and server.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
- React: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for backend development.
- Express: Web application framework for Node.js.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing chat messages.
- Auth0: Authentication and authorization platform.
- Socket.IO: Library for real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): Mechanism for secure cross-origin requests.
